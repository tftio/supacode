/// - `@Shared(.appStorage("sidebarCollapsedRepositoryIDs"))` — legacy
///   flat list of repo IDs whose sidebar section was collapsed.
/// - `@Shared(.appStorage("repositoryOrderIDs"))` — legacy user-
///   curated repo-row order.
/// - `@Shared(.appStorage("worktreeOrderByRepository"))` — legacy
///   per-repo unpinned worktree-row order.
/// - `@Shared(.appStorage("lastFocusedWorktreeID"))` — legacy focused
///   worktree ID.
/// - `@Shared(.appStorage("archivedWorktreeDates"))` — legacy
///   archived-worktree timestamps dictionary.
/// - `@Shared(.appStorage("archivedWorktreeIDs"))` — pre-#214
///   archived-worktree ID list (no timestamps). Stamped with the
///   current date to preserve the behaviour of the retired
///   `ArchivedWorktreeDatesClient.liveValue.load` one-shot fold.
/// - `@Shared(.settingsFile).pinnedWorktreeIDs` — the modernised
///   pinned list already living in `settings.json`.
///
/// Writes to:
/// - `~/.supacode/sidebar.json` via the shared
///   `\.settingsFileStorage` dependency — always, even when the
///   migrated state is empty. The file's presence is the sole
///   idempotency signal on future launches, so we always create it.
///
/// Idempotency is gated on the persisted `schemaVersion`. If
/// `sidebar.json` exists, decodes cleanly, AND carries
/// `schemaVersion >= 1` we skip — including on the downgrade →
/// re-upgrade path, where the older build may have re-populated the
/// legacy UserDefaults blobs but cannot have stamped a migrated
/// schema version on the file. A mere "file exists" check is not
/// enough: if `storage.save(…)` ever failed mid-migration (disk
/// full / permissions / iCloud hiccup) and the first
/// `@Shared(.sidebar)` mutation wrote an empty `SidebarState()`
/// (which defaults `schemaVersion` to `0`), a file-existence gate
/// would short-circuit forever and strand the user's legacy state.
/// Gating on `schemaVersion >= 1` lets the migrator retry in that
/// corner case.
///
/// Ordering: the new `sidebar.json` is written FIRST (with
/// `schemaVersion = 1`); the legacy sources are cleared AFTER.
/// `SettingsFileStorage.save` is atomic, so a crash before the
/// write lands leaves the legacy sources intact for the next
/// launch to retry. A crash between write and clear leaves orphan
/// UserDefaults blobs that no live reader touches (the file gates
/// everything), so they're inert. Worst case: orphaned
/// UserDefaults storage, not lost curation.
///
/// Pre-#214 straggler handling: the main schema-version gate is
/// bypassed for a second time if the legacy pre-#214
/// `archivedWorktreeIDs` list is non-empty on disk. The fold that
/// used to live in `ArchivedWorktreeDatesClient.liveValue.load`
/// was retired during the current branch cleanup, so this migrator
/// is the last reader of that key. We run the ID-list fold inline
/// here regardless of the main gate, stamp `Date.now` on each
/// entry (matching the retired client), and clear only after the
